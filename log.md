# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I developed a [script](https://github.com/Te-k/analyst-scripts/blob/master/misp/yaraxcheck.py) to check sample hosted in MISP with yara rules. I had to add the [download feature](https://github.com/Te-k/python-misp/commit/dd7e56e2bb612618d0d74f27241c36e3180e1674) to [python-misp](https://github.com/nbareil/python-misp) for this.

**Thoughts:** Lot of motivation, but I am not learning that much when doing such script (I have already used python-misp and python-yara a lot)

**Code:**

* [python-misp](https://github.com/Te-k/python-misp)
* [yaraxcheck.py](https://github.com/Te-k/analyst-scripts/blob/master/misp/yaraxcheck.py)
* [idea](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/issues/152)

### Day 2: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added client side password strength estimation using [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) in OpenOversight. I learned how to do [rainbows](https://jsfiddle.net/oLz2hgxp/)

**Thoughts:** I hate CSS

**Code:**

* [commit](https://github.com/Te-k/OpenOversight/commit/0b3f17ededcb0d223a160bdbad67f03e4d2909be)

**Docs**:

* [Password Strength meter](https://css-tricks.com/password-strength-meter/)
* [HTML5 Meter element](https://css-tricks.com/html5-meter-element/)

### Day 3: January 20th

**Today's Progress**: I started to rewrite my HTTP scanner with more ideas, it need a bit more work but it will be functional soon (although some ideas I have will be hard to implement)

**Code:** Not published yet, hope to have a v1 tomorrow
