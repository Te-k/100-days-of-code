# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

## Contents
* [Log - click here to see my progress](log.md)
* [Resources](resources.md)

## Here are my rules

1. I will code for 100 days at least one hour per day
2. My objective is to learn how to write better code, learn more devops tools and lear Go (see my plan here after)
3. I will publish as much open source code as I can, with some restriction (or delay)
4. I won't consider the development done during my work (except sometimes if I am doing a lot of dev :p)
2. I will write a daily log [here](log.md)
5. I will compile interesting resources [here](resources.md)
3. I will encourage other people to join or to keep the challenge going, especially [@sa0un](https://twitter.com/sa0un) and [@daniellecrobins](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) who motivated me for this challenge

## My plan

Here are my plans for these 100 days of code

* Learn the Go language, because it is a compiled language with very good support for security libraries
* Learn how to write better python, especially in code organisation and web development
* Work and end a project not public yet, but which will finally be released (called SecretProject1 in the logs)
* Help a friend in her research with a second secret project (called SecretProject2)
* Continue developing and publishing my [analyst scripts](https://github.com/Te-k/analyst-scripts)
* Try to sort out the different projects I have in my mind and work on them
