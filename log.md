# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I developed a [script](https://github.com/Te-k/analyst-scripts/blob/master/misp/yaraxcheck.py) to check sample hosted in MISP with yara rules. I had to add the [download feature](https://github.com/Te-k/python-misp/commit/dd7e56e2bb612618d0d74f27241c36e3180e1674) to [python-misp](https://github.com/nbareil/python-misp) for this.

**Thoughts:** Lot of motivation, but I am not learning that much when doing such script (I have already used python-misp and python-yara a lot)

**Code:**

* [python-misp](https://github.com/Te-k/python-misp)
* [yaraxcheck.py](https://github.com/Te-k/analyst-scripts/blob/master/misp/yaraxcheck.py)
* [idea](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/issues/152)
